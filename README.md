# Digital Humanities Reflection 

At the start of this course, my understanding of digital humanities was sparked by the intriguing combination of two fields I find fascinating. While not the sole focus of my current academic path,  I've always been drawn to both technology and the humanities. There was a time when I seriously considered pursuing them more deeply, and they certainly seem to represent the future of humanistic inquiry, especially in an age where headlines constantly declare the decline of traditional humanities disciplines in universities.

Initially, I envisioned digital humanities as primarily focused on the technical aspects of digitization: transcribing historical documents, creating digital archives, and organizing historical information using technology.  While this perception wasn't entirely inaccurate, it lacked the nuanced understanding I've gained throughout this course. Digital humanities is far more than just applying technology to historical materials; it's about  bridging the gap between the past and present, fostering deeper understanding and empathy through innovative and engaging forms of storytelling.

My contributions to the Printing in Prisons and Holiday Experiences at Eastern State Penitentiary (ESP) projects demonstrate the transformation in my understanding of digital humanities. Through my projects, I experienced firsthand how Digital humanities is the intersection of art, technology, and history that can be leveraged to forge a deeper or more nuanced emotional connection with the past. At the beginning of the semester, I viewed historical data as a collection of facts and figures that were most useful when clearly organized and easily accessible. However, these projects revealed the dynamic nature of historical data, showing how it carries within it powerful stories that reflect the complexities of the individuals and eras they belong to. Through creative digital applications and research methods, my classmates and I discovered how we can bridge the gap between abstract data and the human stories embedded within to ultimately evoke emotional resonance with our audience.

My blog post on Frieda Trost was when I first began to appreciate digital humanities ability to foster greater empathy and understanding. Initially, her life appeared to be defined by scandal and tragedy - a narrative largely shaped by the sensationalized media of her time. However, as I delved deeper into her prison records, The Umpire, newspaper clippings, and other documents, I began to see beyond this superficial portrayal. Frieda's story was not only one of alleged crimes, but also a testament to resilience,  redemption, and the complexities of human nature. By incorporating quotes from The Umpire, that revealed her acts of kindness and patriotism, I was able to create a article that worked to redefine her narrative. For example, her gesture of purchasing an American flag for her prison block served as a powerful symbol of pride and community spirit within the confines of Eastern State Penitentiary. These details helped support my thesis was  Frieda was not the caricatured black widow she was made out to be but a multidimensional individual who navigated profound loss, societal judgment, and ultimately, rehabilitation. This process of humanizing the subject of my research reminded me of  Dan Bouk's argument in Democracy's Data which was that data carries the imprint of both its creators and its subjects, revealing the social and cultural norms of a particular time. In Frieda's case, the data reflect her circumstances and unveil a story of a woman grappling with and navigating the often oppressive systems of her era.

Similarly, our holiday timeline project at Eastern State Penitentiary showed how digital humanities can turn data into an engaging narrative. In analyzing prisoner mentions of holidays in The Umpire, we worked to capture how incarcerated individuals experienced the holidays to better understand their experiences and humanize them to our audience. The timeline visually depicted these mentions, transforming what might have been a simple chart into a narrative about hope and resilience within the prison system. This project also drew on the principles of ethical representation, as discussed in The Digital Panopticon. Just as the Panopticon team grappled with the ethical implications of digitizing convict lives, we considered how to present prisoner experiences in a way that invited empathy and understanding. We decided to do this by designing a physical tree adorned with ornaments representing different holidays, where viewers could not only see the data but also feel the weight and importance of the holidays as with each mention throughout the year.

One of my strengths throughout these projects was my ability to synthesize historical narratives from fragmented and often disjointed sources. For the Printing in Prisons blog, I meticulously pieced together elements from prison records, newspaper accounts, and personal anecdotes to create a nuanced portrayal of Frieda Trost. This process went beyond simply compiling data; it was about weaving those fragments into a compelling story. This strength also carried into the Holiday Experiences at ESP project, where I contributed to making sure project focused on being empathetic of the incarcerated people's experience and emotionally resonant with our viewers. My attention to detail and ability to contextualize data contributed to our group creating a project that invited viewers to empathize with the incarcerated individuals we sought to represent. However, both projects had areas where I could have improved. In the ESP timeline project, our initial ambitions, while well-intentioned, ultimately constrained the depth of our final product. We envisioned laser-cut ornaments for the holiday tree, each intricately designed to represent a specific holiday or emotion, creating a tally of how many times each holiday was mentioned, detailing on the ornaments were specifically in The Umpire it was mentioned. However, the complexity of this task, coupled with the time required to troubleshoot technical issues, forced us to simplify our design. While the final project successfully evoked empathy, it lacked the additional layer of detail that a more systematic representation of holiday mentions could have provided. The Printing in Prisons blog, however, was limited by the scope of historical materials I was able to access. While I drew extensively from official records and media portrayals, I now recognize the potential value of Frieda Trost's personal correspondence, the minutes of her court hearing, and other firsthand accounts. Incorporating these sources could have added greater emotional nuance to her story, providing a deeper understanding of her inner world and the choices she made. For instance, personal letters might have revealed her reflections on motherhood, loss, and imprisonment, enriching the narrative beyond what was publicly recorded. This would have helped me better overcome the ethical challenges raised in The Digital Panopticon, which cautions against over-interpreting fragmented data and encourages seeing out additional information to create a complete and balanced representation. 

Furthermore, the workshops challenged what we thought about in class, pariticulalry the Rutgers Era of Generative AI. Specifically, John Burmeister’s metaphor of the Centaur, a hybrid model of human intellect and AI, challenged me to fundamentally rethink the role of digital tools in the context of our class. His framing of AI as a “possibility machine” that generates diverse ideas and hypotheses encouraged a shift in perspective. Instead of viewing technology as an end in itself, we should being to see it as a collaborative partner that amplifies human creativity and critical thinking. By shifting our perspective from seeing technology as a tool to viewing it as a collaborator, Burmeister’s metaphor helped me more deeply appreciate the transformative potential of digital humanities. It also reinforced the core importance of human insight, empathy, and ethical consideration in this age of generative AI. To learn more about my workshop experience at Penn and Rutgers click here. 

I had not realized or been able to clearly articulate until the end of the semester when we were asked to describe digital humanities in one work that the key theme was empathy. In fact, the theme of empathy is what pulled me into the course and engrossed me into the improtnat of the work and the field itself. 

Utliamtly, working on the Printing in Prisons and Holiday Experiences at ESP projects reignited a passion I had nearly forgotten: my love for the humanities and investigative journalism. In high school, I was deeply involved in uncovering and telling stories, diving headfirst into research, and weaving together narratives that exposed hidden truths or explained complicated concepts clearly. However, as I moved toward more technical and scientific disciplines, this passion gradually faded into the background. Revisiting these skills through our digital humanities projects was both a nostalgic exercise and an incredible reminder of the thrill of digging deep into archives, critically questioning sources, and crafting compelling narratives. 

Looking Forward: 
Develop Technical Skills in Data Visualization and Digital Storytelling
To improve my ability to create compelling digital humanities projects, I plan to take courses that focus on data visualization and computational tools for storytelling. Specifically, I aim to enroll in a course like Data Science for the Humanities, which combines technical skills with humanistic inquiry. Additionally, I want to explore workshops through Penn Libraries that explain how to use tools like Tableau or Gephi to analyze and present complex datasets. 

Deepen My Understanding of Investigative Storytelling
Inspired by the Printing in Prisons blog, I want to revisit my passion for investigative journalism. I plan to read books like Katherine Boo’s Behind the Beautiful Forevers and Nikole Hannah-Jones’s The 1619 Project to learn how experienced journalists navigate complex narratives while centering marginalized voices. I will also seek out opportunities to write for campus publications or digital platforms, such as The Daily Pennsylvanian, something I have always wanted to do but previously felt unsure about my abilities.

Research Projects
To sustain my engagement with digital humanities, I will actively seek out research opportunities that allow me to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects and explore minoring in Digital Humanities. I plan to connect with Penn’s Price Lab for Digital Humanities to find research initiatives where I can contribute my skills in archival analysis and digital storytelling. Specifically, I will reach out to faculty members whose work aligns with my interests in ethical storytelling and the intersection of technology and history. Collaborating with others will help me refine my skills while contributing to meaningful projects that amplify underrepresented voices and narratives.
